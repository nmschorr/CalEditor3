This project takes ics calendar output from Solar Fire and reformats it to correct mistakes and to view more productively.

The data for the calendar is calculated with Solar Fire 8 on Windows XP. 

Once imported into a Google Calendar - For this calendar to display with the correct times, you must have your Google time zone settings set correctly.  It's possible they are already set correctly by default. To check, see this page:
