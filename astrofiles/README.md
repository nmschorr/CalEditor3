This program uses Python. 

It translates "nfi"-files into aaf files.

astfiles.py is the main file that is run.  astrs.py is the function library.  setup.py is there to create the exe file. extra.txt is extra code and notes associated with the project.

The in directory is cInputDIR ='C:\\astin'     It must be there for the program to run. The nfi files go inside it.

The results are put in the outdir at 'C:\\astout'. This is where you are sorting to, and it's created if it's not there.
